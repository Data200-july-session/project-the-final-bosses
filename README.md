# Data 200 Applied Statistical Analysis  
## Project Work  
**“Exploring Real-World Data through Statistical and Predictive Modeling”**

---

### Objective:  
Students will apply statistical and predictive modeling techniques to analyze a real-world dataset relevant to their areas of interest (e.g., Healthcare, Marketing, Sports, Finance, Education, etc.). The project will focus on:  
- Cleaning and structuring data.  
- Applying statistical analysis techniques such as Linear Regression, ANOVA, or Logistic Regression.  
- Developing a simple end-to-end application.  
- Generating a comprehensive report to document choices, insights, and conclusions.

### Deliverables and Deadlines  

#### **Week 1: Group Formation and Topic Finalization**  
- Form project groups.
- Finalize the project topic.
- Identify the problem statement.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Idea presentation.  

#### **Week 2: Literature Review and Dataset Selection**  
- Conduct a literature review to establish context and relevance.  
- Select a suitable dataset.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Submit at least 3 literature reviews of related works.  

#### **Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Perform EDA using descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand data patterns and relationships.  
- Preprocess the data: Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates, and perform other data wrangling techniques.  
- Check relationships in data

**Deliverables:**  
- EDA summary with key insights supported by visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, histograms, box plots).  

#### **Week 4: Statistical Model Selection and Hypothesis Development**  
- Select appropriate statistical techniques (e.g., Regression, ANOVA, Logistic Regression) based on the problem statement.  
- Perform feature selection and develop hypotheses.  

**Deliverables:**  
- A short slide deck with justification of model and feature choices.  

#### **Week 5: Statistical Analysis and Validation**  
- Conduct descriptive and inferential statistical analysis tests using Python.  
- Perform diagnostics measures
- Interpret results and validate hypotheses.  
- If necessary, choose sampling methods or collect additional data (e.g., through questionnaires or Google Forms).  

---
#### **Week 6: Statistical Modeling (Continued…)**  
- Build on the analysis from Week 5.  
- Finalize insights and begin compiling the project report.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Present statistical analysis results and insights.  
- Also, present the report draft for progress tracking.  

#### **Week 7: Application Development**  
- Simple Python Application Creation for project demonstration using libraries of student’s choice.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Locally running Python application.  

#### **Week 8: Peer Evaluation and Final Presentation**  
- Conduct peer evaluations (review at least two projects).  
- Prepare and present findings in a 10-minute presentation.  
- Submit the final report with documentation.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Final report with detailed documentation.  
- Presentation slides.  
- Peer evaluation feedback.
